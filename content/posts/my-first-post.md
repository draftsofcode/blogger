The summer I turned nine years old, I took a computer programming course geared towards children. I spent three months learning logo basic. This experience helped me to develop stronger critical thinking skills. Fast-forward to today, after 23 years of "hand on keyboard" software development and 29 years in IT and I have thought of so many hobby projects that I would love to spend time building. However, career and life will sometimes get in the way. 

draftsOfCode is my blog where I will share the build and design process for many of these hobbie projects. As one can imagine, I have several thoughts on potential hobby projects. Some of them include:

* Word Games
* Order Management Solutions
* Post Purchase Solutions
* Debt Calculator
* Emoji Collections
* Something crazy involving Tyler Perry
* Bible Trivia
* Book Collection Site
* Movie Database like IMDB
