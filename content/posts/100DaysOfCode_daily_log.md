# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 29, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Wrote blog post announcing [#100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/rules/).

**Thoughts:** Getting Hugo set up was pretty straightforward. However, I ran into challenges hosting on Render.com and decided to switch over to Netlify. My biggest challenge on Render.com is that after a few commits, it stopped watching the github repository and wouldn't rebuild the site. So, I switched over to Netlify which has, so far, rebuilt the site on every commit. 

The other interesting thing is that there is no way to change an image's size in generic Markdown. So, I ended up using the [figure](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#figure) shortcode which made this possible.

Getting going and keeping going will likely be challenging. I just hope to get a straightforward playable version of the game going.
